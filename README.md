## Tasks managing application

Build a task managing app, where the user can add, filter, assign, and complete tasks.

* The app should have two screens: the list screen and the details screen. Use the Angular router to manage the
  transitions between them.
* Use your favorite library for state management, you can use a different approach if you think it fits better.
* Write a few tests. The goal here is not to build a production-quality app, so don't test every single detail.
  Two or three tests should be good enough.
* Don't forget about error handling and race conditions.
